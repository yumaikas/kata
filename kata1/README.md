# Trigrams

http://codekata.com/kata/kata14-tom-swift-under-the-milkwood/

Trigram analysis is very simple. Look at each set of three adjacent words in a
document. Use the first two words of the set as a key, and remember the fact
that the third word followed that key. Once youâ€™ve finished, you know the list
of individual words that can follow each two word sequence in the document. For
example, given the input:

```
I wish I may I wish I might
```
You might generate:

```
"I wish" => ["I", "I"]
"wish I" => ["may", "might"]
"may I"  => ["wish"]
"I may"  => ["I"]
```

To generate new text from this analysis, choose an arbitrary word pair as a
starting point. Use these to look up a random next word (using the table above)
and append this new word to the text so far. This now gives you a new word pair
at the end of the text, so look up a potential next word based on these. Add
this to the list, and so on...

See the main article for more details!


# Tasks

* Using the dictionary listed above ("I wish I may I wish I might"), select a random
key as the start of your sentence, and use the dictionary to attach a word to it.
* Loop through this process with the final 2 words in your sentence each time
to extend the sentence. Stop the loop when you reach a key that does not exist
in your dictionary.
* Build a simple algorithm that analyses a piece of text and builds a data
structure containing your trigrams from it.
* Apply your loop from the first few tasks to that text to produce a new story.
* Post your best stories in slack!

Bonus:

* Feed your altgorithm from a file containing a large amount of text, e.g. a book from Project Gutenberg.
* Automate feeding the algorithm with more books from Project Gutenberg.
